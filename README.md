Archive of images retrieved from titles.xml
# Disclaimer
This repository contains no Nintendo 3DS/Wii U game ROMs, backups, etc. Only images and metadata retrievable from the Nintendo 3DS/Wii U eShop.
# July 2025 Update
Files have been merged and reorganized for efficiency sake. The included shell scripts are to fix what had already been done by my poorly written tool a couple years ago. Plans are being made to create a new scraper, as the CDN images still seem to be available.
# TODOs
* ~~Get additional store XMLs for different regions~~ Done (I think it finally is at least for Wii U, ~~i need to fetch the 3DS stuff all over again though~~)
* ~~Get banner_url images~~ Done (unless i magically forgot some, which is entirely possible but now less likely)
* Get rating system icon images (e.g. ESRB logos)
* ~~Get Wii U (WUP) titles~~ Done (probably)
* Get game screenshots and videos from each title's page (may or may not do this)
